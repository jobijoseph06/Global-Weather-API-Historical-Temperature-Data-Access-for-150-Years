Weather Data API with Flask

This project uses Flask to create a weather API that provides temperature data from a dataset containing 100 weather stations, spanning the last 150 years. The API allows users to retrieve temperature information by providing a station ID and date. The backend reads and processes large weather data files and returns the temperature for specific days, months, or even yearly summaries. Missing or invalid data is handled with a default message to ensure a smooth user experience.

Key Features:

Retrieve temperature data by station ID and date.
View yearly data for a specific station.
Handle missing or invalid data gracefully.
Interactive frontend using HTML and Flask for querying the API.
Feel free to explore, contribute, or use this project as a resource for weather data analysis.
